The DevOps lifecycle is a continuous loop that streamlines software delivery. It starts with planning and development, moves through build and testing, and then proceeds to release and deployment. Finally, the software is operated and monitored, with feedback driving the next cycle, ensuring faster, reliable, and high-quality delivery.
